# Food Recommendation System



## Description

From the earliest stages of foetal development to old age, nutrition is the most important factor in human health and growth. Healthy
diet and nutrition are unquestionably necessary for survival, physical development, mental growth, performance and productivity, as well as health and well-being. With increasing cases of health related problems as well as malnutrition/obesity and lack of nutrition related guidance it is imperative to have a system to recommend diet based food/meals. We propose a system which can recommend meals based on nutritional requirements/preferences as required
by the user.
